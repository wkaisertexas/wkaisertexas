### 🔬 International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF) Analysis

Diving deep into ISEF, the world's top science fair with competition data. Examining both historical trends and creating visualizations to help newcomers demystify this competition.

- A [LinkedIn Article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/behind-innovation-insights-from-international-science-william-kaiser) written to explain key findings and methodologies in a narrative form
- An [Interactive t-SNE Visualization](https://wkaisertexas.github.io/all-isef-projects/) to help those new to science fair to explore project ideas

### Mandelbulb in Web GPU

I rendered the 3D Mandelbulb fractal in a web browser using WebGPU, the successor to WebGL. This fascinating fractal is a perfect example of how infinite series can be used to create stunning visual art.

### 🎥 Time Lapse

- Easily create time lapses of your screen and webcams
- Intended for programmers, hobbyists and artists to showcase their creations
- Saves wasteful frames which would have been discarded when edited into a time lapse (a hour long screen recording can easily be several gigabytes)

<!-- ### 📍 Textual and Impact-Based CORD19 Clustering  -->

<!-- Created an interactive t-SNE plot of papers from the COVID Open Research Dataset (CORD19). Used data from [Altmetric](https://www.altmetric.com) to create clusters based on impact (citations from various sources). Found very strong statistical correlation between cluster location and impact. -->

<!-- - [Kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/williamkaiser/textual-and-impact-based-cord19-clustering) for the project -->

<!-- ### 📝 Society for Science - Science Fair Project Scraper -->
<!-- [Here](https://github.com/wkaisertexas/all-isef-projects) is a project that helps people scrape [Society for Science](https://abstracts.societyforscience.org/) to download their database of science fair projects.  -->

<!-- ### ♺ Random URL Generator [^1] -->
<!-- [Random URL Generator](https://github.com/wkaisertexas/randomurl) makes shortened URLs with random destinations. One link has a set of predefined destinations with respective probabilities. Then, when the user clicks on the link, one of the destinations is picked at random. -->

<!-- **Example**: Site that randomly takes you to technology companies' websites -->
<!-- - 25% - facebook.com -->
<!-- - 25% - google.com -->
<!-- - 25% - apple.com -->
<!-- - 25% - microsoft.com -->

<!-- > Note: this project was a victim of the recent changes to Heroku deployments and is no longer publicly available.  -->

<!-- > Built-in link tracking of link destinations makes **A / B testing** more accessible -->
