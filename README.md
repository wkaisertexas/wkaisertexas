## Featured Projects 

### 🔬 International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF) Analysis

Diving deep into ISEF, the world's top science fair with competition data. Examining both historical trends and creating visualizations to help newcomers demystify this competition.

Four main components are present in this project:
- [Article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/behind-innovation-insights-from-international-science-william-kaiser) written to explain key findings and methodologies in an accessible manner.
- [Kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/wkaisertexas/international-science-fair-analysis) which provides the source for figures and findings
- [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wkaisertexas/all-international-science-fair-projects) allows anyone to access ISEF data to complete their own findings
- [Interactive t-SNE Visualization](https://wkaisertexas.github.io/all-isef-projects/) to explore project categories

### 🎥 TimeLapse
- Easily create timelapses of your screen and webcams
- Intended for programmers, hobbyists and artists to showcase their creations
- Saves wasteful frames which would have been discarded when edited into a timelapse (a hour long screen recording can easily be several gigabytes)

### ⬆️ TikTok Uploader

A python module which uses Selenium to automatically upload videos to TikTok. Supports both module calls and a command-line interface.
- [Repo](https://github.com/wkaisertexas/tiktok-uploader)
- [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/tiktok_uploader/)

### 📍 Textual and Impact-Based CORD19 Clustering 

Created an interactive t-SNE plot of papers from the COVID Open Research Dataset (CORD19). Used data from [Altmetric](https://www.altmetric.com) to create clusters based on impact (citations from various sources). Found very strong statistical correlation between cluster location and impact.

### 📝 Society for Science - Science Fair Project Scraper
[Here](https://github.com/wkaisertexas/all-isef-projects) is a project that helps people scrape [Society for Science](https://abstracts.societyforscience.org/) to download their database of science fair projects. 

### ♺ Random URL Generator [^1]
[Random URL Generator](https://github.com/wkaisertexas/randomurl) makes shortened URLs with random destinations. One link has a set of predefined destinations with respective probabilities. Then, when the user clicks on the link, one of the destinations is picked at random.

**Example**: Site that randomly takes you to technology companies' websites
- 25% - facebook.com
- 25% - google.com
- 25% - apple.com
- 25% - microsoft.com

> Note: this project was a victim of the recent changes to Heroku deployments and is no longer publicly available. 

> Built-in link tracking of link destinations makes **A / B testing** more accessible
