### Random URL Generator [^1]
[Random URL Generator](https://random-url-generator.herokuapp.com/) makes shortened URLs with random destinations. One link has a set of predefined destinations with respective proabilities. Then, when the user clicks on the link, one of the destinations is picked at random.

Example: Site that takes you to FAMG (not ***FANG***) websites randomly.
- 25% - facebook.com
- 25% - google.com
- 25% - apple.com
- 25% - microsoft.com

#### Why?
This was designed for High School clubs so that they could have a QR code redirect to the club's website, remind, etc. Basically, a bad linktree now that I think about it.

Also, there are some kind of goated features in there. 
1. Editable URLs (QR codes with posters can have their URLs changed after the fact )
2. Viewcounts for URLs (See how popular a poster is)

### Society for Science -- Science Fair Project Scraper
[Here](https://github.com/wkaisertexas/all-isef-projects) is a project that helps people scrape [Society for Science](https://abstracts.societyforscience.org/) to download their database of science fair projects. 

#### Why?
I really want someone to do a meta science fair project where they look at the factors that make other science fair projects successful.
